# MRI Brain Tumor Detection (Deep Learning)

A beginner-friendly deep learning project to classify MRI brain tumor images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## What this project does
- Loads MRI images
- Preprocesses the images
- Trains a CNN model using Keras/TensorFlow
- Predicts tumor vs non-tumor images

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## Folder Structure
- `notebooks/` (training / testing notebooks)
- `src/` (python scripts)
- `data/` (empty – dataset not included)
- `assets/` (screenshots or result images)

## How to Run (Later when code is added)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
